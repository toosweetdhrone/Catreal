Configure your project settings, including:
Target platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Screen resolution and aspect ratio.
Graphics quality settings (if applicable).
Choose 2D or 3D Mode:

Indicate whether you want to create a 2D or 3D game. Configure the engine accordingly.

Step 2: Asset Loading

Asset Management:

Navigate to the asset management section of your development environment.
Import or Create Assets:

Import or create the necessary game assets, including textures, 2D sprites, 3D models, audio files, and any other resources your game requires.
Organize Assets:

Organize your assets within the engine's asset management system, creating folders or categories to keep things tidy.

Step 3: Basic Rendering

Create a Scene:

Set up a scene where your game will take place. This might include defining a world or level and placing objects within it.
Initialize Rendering:

In your game's initialization code, initialize the rendering system for either 2D or 3D graphics, depending on your chosen mode.
Load Textures and Models:

Use the asset management system to load the textures and 3D models you need for your scene.
Set Up Cameras (For 3D Games):

Configure cameras to control the player's view in 3D space. Define camera position, orientation, and perspective.
Implement Basic Rendering Logic:

For 2D Games:
In your game loop, use the engine's rendering functions to draw 2D sprites and textures to the screen.
Position and scale sprites as needed to create your game's visuals.
For 3D Games:
In your game loop, set up the view and projection matrices for the camera.
Use the engine's rendering functions to draw 3D models to the screen.
Apply shaders and materials to control the appearance of objects.
Render the Scene:

Inside your game loop, call the rendering functions to render the scene. This should include rendering all visible objects in the scene.
Update the Display:

Ensure that the display is updated at the appropriate frame rate. Use the engine's capabilities to manage frame timing.
User Input Handling:

Implement code to handle user input, such as keyboard, mouse, or gamepad controls. This will allow the player to interact with the game.
Basic Gameplay Logic:

Implement basic gameplay logic within the game loop. For example, you might move characters, detect collisions, and update the game state.

Step 4: Testing and Iteration

Compile and Run:

Compile your project and run the game within the engine's runtime environment. Test it to ensure that the assets are loaded and rendering correctly.
Debug and Optimize:

Use the engine's debugging tools to identify and fix issues. Optimize your code and assets for better performance.
